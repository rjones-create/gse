KERNEL.md

This repository defines one small, boring tool.

GSE validates the structure of a JSON document against a published JSON Schema.

That is the entire scope.

Non-Claims

This repository does not define meaning.

It does not define governance.

It does not define authority.

It does not define policy.

It does not enforce behavior.

It only checks whether a document conforms to the declared schema.

Any semantics, governance interpretations, or operational decisions exist outside this repository and are the responsibility of the human operator.

Change Rule

The public contract is:
schema/v1.json
README.md

Schemas are immutable once published.

Breaking changes require a new schema version.

Additive changes may be published only as new versions if they risk ambiguity or misinterpretation.

Operating Posture

Small.
Correct.
Honest.
Boring on purpose.
Legally clean.

If this repository starts to feel like a system, it is out of scope.
